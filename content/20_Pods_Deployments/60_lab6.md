## Challenge

Create a namespace called `accounts` all the following steps need to be done in this namespace

Deploy a deployment named `redis-app` using the image `redis` with 2 replicas
- with labels `tier=prod` and `loc=north`

Deploy a deployment named `redis-db` using the image `redis:alpine` with 2 replicas
- with labels `tier=prod` and `loc=south`
- Expose the redis-db deployment on a port 6379.

Use labels to query the pods
- list pod with label `tier=prod`
- list pods with label `loc=south`

Alter deployment `redis-app`
- add label `region=emea`
- change label `tier=prod` to `tier=dev`

## Solution

> [doc reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

```bash
# create the namespace
kubectl create ns accounts
# create the deployments (imperative for speed)
kubectl create deployment redis-app --image=redis --replicas=2 -n accounts
kubectl create deployment redis-db --image=redis:alpine --replicas=2 -n accounts 
# expose redis-db
kubectl expose deployment redis-db --port=6379 -n accounts
# change the labels on the deployment
kubectl label deployment redis-app tier=prod loc=north -n accounts
kubectl label deployment redis-db tier=prod loc=south -n accounts
```
> Are the deployments and there pods labelled the same? (ignore the pod-template-hash )
> why?
>> Because the label changes were made on the deployments after the pods were created (with the original labels).
>> You would need to label the pods as well to match or restart the deployments to have matching labels

```bash
# list pods with tier=prod
kubectl get pods -n accounts -l tier=prod
# list pods with loc=south
kubectl get pods -n accounts -l tier=south

# Add labels on deployment 
kubectl label deployment redis-app region=emea-n accounts
# Modify labels. As the label exists we need the overwrite option
kubectl label deployment redis-app tier=dev --overwrite -n accounts

```
