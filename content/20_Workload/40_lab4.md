## Challenge

Create a job called dicey using
 - image `kodekloud/throw-dice` 

The image generates a random number between 1 and 6 and exits. It is a success only if it is a 6 else it is a failure. Check how many times it takes the job to trigger to get a successful outcome.

## Solution

> [doc reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/ "Kubernetes Jobs")

```bash
# create the job
kubectl create job dicey --image=kodekloud/throw-dice

# check - you should see how many attempts before rolling a 6
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod name>

```

## Challenge

Create a job with the above image to 
 - generate 8 successful outcomes. 
 - attempts no more than 15 attempts

> [parallelism reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#controlling-parallelism)
> [backofflimit reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-backoff-failure-policy)

```bash
#create a job

kubectl create job dicey2 --image=kodekloud/throw-dice --dry-run=client -o yaml > dicey2.yaml

# edit it so it looks like this

# check the output

kubectl get jobs
