## Challenge

Use `kubectl` to

- Create a `pod` called `pod-1`
  - image 'nginx'
- Create a `pod` called `redis`
  - image 'redis:1.99'  
  - identify the problem with the pod
  - rectify the problem with the pod
- Create a `deployment` called `busybox-1`
  - image 'busybox'  
  - with 3 replicas 
  - and commmand `sleep 3600`
- Update the `deployment` called `busybox-1`
  - image `ubuntu`
