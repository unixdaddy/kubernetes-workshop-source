## Solution

> [doc reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset)


```bash
# create a deployment
kubectl create deployment dset --image=quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2 --dry-run=client -o yaml > dset.yaml

# edit the yaml to change it from a deployment to daemonset make the below changes
kind: Deployment 
change to -->   kind: DaemonSet

 remove  creationTimestamp: null
 remove  replicas: 1
 remove  strategy
 remove  resources
 remove  status

# so it now looks like this
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: DaemonSet     
metadata:          
  labels:         
    app: dset    
  name: dset    
spec:         
  selector:  
    matchLabels:
      app: dset
  template:   
    metadata:
      labels: 
        app: dset
    spec:       
      containers: 
      - image: quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2  
        name: fluentd             

# apply the file
kubectl apply -f dset.yaml

# check the results - this should show the number of pods = number of nodes and node column shows different nodes
kubectl get pods -o wide -l=app=dset
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE          NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
dset-pmrn5   1/1     Running   0          34m   192.168.106.6    k8s-worker2   <none>           <none>
dset-tpltj   1/1     Running   0          34m   192.168.104.68   k8s-worker1   <none>           <none>

## Solution

> [doc reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset)

The daemonset will automatically deploy a pod to the new node, see the doc reference which has the following quote

> A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.
