# Workload Objects

Workload objects can be a simple POD with 1 or many containers. Alternatively other workload objects can be used to manage the
lifetime of the POD - deployments, replicasets (don't use them directly), statefulset, daemonset etc... 

This image shows the workload objects - **only some are required for CKA**

In this section we are going to focus on PODs and Deployments (and to a lesser extent Services) in order test those areas for CKA. 

In the diagram below we see the relationship between the 3 workload objects (deployment, replicaset, 3 pods) and 1 Networking Object (the service)
